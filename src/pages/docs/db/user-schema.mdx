# User Schema Documentation

This document provides a detailed description of the `User` schema used in our application. The schema is defined using Mongoose, a MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment.

## User Schema

The `UserSchema` defines the structure and constraints of the User documents stored in the MongoDB collection.

```typescript
import { Schema, model, models } from "mongoose";

const UserSchema = new Schema({
  clerkId: { type: String, required: true, unique: true },
  email: { type: String, required: true, unique: true },
  firstName: { type: String, required: true },
  lastName: { type: String, required: true },
  photo: { type: String, required: true },
  role: { type: String, required: true },
});
```

## User Model

The `User` model is created using the `UserSchema`. It is either retrieved from the existing models or created if it does not exist.

```typescript
const User = models.User || model("User", UserSchema);

export default User;
```

### Field Descriptions

- **clerkId**: A unique identifier for the user provided by the authentication service (required, unique).
- **email**: The user's email address (required, unique).
- **firstName**: The user's first name (required).
- **lastName**: The user's last name (required).
- **photo**: The URL of the user's profile photo (required).
- **role**: The user's role within the application (required).

This schema ensures that all necessary fields are validated and appropriately constrained, providing a robust structure for storing user-related data in the database.

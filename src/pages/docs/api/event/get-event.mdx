# `getEventById`

This documentation covers the `getEventById` function, which is responsible for retrieving a single event record from the database by its ID in the application.

## Function: `getEventById`

### Description

The `getEventById` function is an asynchronous function that retrieves a single event record from the MongoDB database by its ID. It performs necessary validations to ensure the event exists.

### Parameters

- `eventId` (string): The ID of the event to be retrieved.

### Return Value

- Returns a JSON stringified version of the event if found.
- Throws an error if the event is not found or if there is any other issue during the retrieval process.

### Example Usage

```javascript
export async function getEventById(eventId: string) {
  try {
    await connectToDatabase();

    const event = await populateEvent(Event.findById(eventId));

    if (!event) throw new Error("Event not found");

    return JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(event));
  } catch (error) {
    handleError(error);
  }
}
```

### Error Handling

- The function uses a try-catch block to handle errors.
- If the event is not found, it throws an "Event not found" error.
- Any other errors encountered during the retrieval process are passed to the `handleError` function for handling.

### Dependencies

- `connectToDatabase`: A function to connect to the MongoDB database.
- `Event`: A MongoDB model representing the event.
- `populateEvent`: A function to populate the event with necessary details (e.g., references to other collections).
- `handleError`: A function to handle errors.

### Notes

- Ensure that the `eventId` parameter is correctly validated before calling this function.
- This function assumes that the necessary MongoDB model (`Event`) and utility functions (`connectToDatabase`, `populateEvent`, `handleError`) are properly defined and imported in your application.

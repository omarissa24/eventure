# `deleteUser`

This documentation covers the `deleteUser` function, which is responsible for deleting a user record from the database in the application.

## Function: `deleteUser`

### Description

The `deleteUser` function is an asynchronous function that deletes an existing user record from the MongoDB database. It validates the user ID and deletes the user.

### Parameters

- `userId` (string): The ID of the user to be deleted.

### Return Value

- Returns a JSON stringified version of the deleted user if successful.
- Throws an error if the user is not found or if there is any issue during the deletion process.

### Example Usage

```javascript
export async function deleteUser(userId: string) {
  try {
    await connectToDatabase();

    const deletedUser = await User.findByIdAndDelete(userId);
    if (!deletedUser) throw new Error("User not found");
    return JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(deletedUser));
  } catch (error) {
    handleError(error);
  }
}
```

### Error Handling

- The function uses a try-catch block to handle errors.
- If the user is not found, it throws a "User not found" error.
- Any other errors encountered during the deletion process are passed to the `handleError` function for handling.

### Dependencies

- `connectToDatabase`: A function to connect to the MongoDB database.
- `User`: A MongoDB model representing the user.
- `handleError`: A function to handle errors.

### Notes

- Ensure that the `userId` parameter is correctly validated before calling this function.
- This function assumes that the necessary MongoDB model (`User`) and utility functions (`connectToDatabase`, `handleError`) are properly defined and imported in your application.
